```
yarn
yarn dev
```

## System Overview
This application consists of a frontend and a backend system. The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It handles rendering of the interface that users interact with. The backend handles requests from the frontend and interacts with the database. It is built with Express.js.

## Architecture
The frontend and backend are separate entities. They communicate through APIs, with the backend offering RESTful APIs. The major API endpoints include '/api/projects' for projects-related functionalities, '/api/users' for handling user data, and '/api/auth' for authentication related tasks.

<!-- Removed content
## How do I deploy this?

## SMS Support with Twilio (Optional)

## GPT3 Example Integration

## TODOs/ Feature Requests

-->
```
twilio phone-numbers:update PHONE_NUMBER --sms-url https://RANDOM_STRING.ngrok.io/messages
```

You'll need the Twilio CLI installed. You'll need to "upgrade" to paid if you want to remove the Twilio branding from the SMS replies.

### Dependencies

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your TWILIO and OPENAI Keys, and your personal PHONE_NUMBER.

### Compile the TypeScript to JavaScript

Compile the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Note that this runs the TypeScript compiler, `tsc`, you could also run `npx tsc` to get the same output.

The TypeScript project will be compiled into the `dist` directory. You can also continuously compile the project as it changes with:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Run the project

Start the web server with:

```bash
npm start
```

### Expose the local server with ngrok

To respond to an incoming webhook you will need a publicly available URL. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a tool that can tunnel through from a public URL to your machine. Once you've [downloaded and installed ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) you can run it like so:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

The ngrok terminal will show you a URL, like `https://RANDOM_STRING.ngrok.io`.

### Connect your phone number to your app

Using the ngrok URL from the last part, you can set up your Twilio phone number with your application. [Edit your phone number](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming) and in the Messaging section, next to when "A message comes in" enter your ngrok URL with the path `/messages`.

```
https://RANDOM_STRING.ngrok.io/messages
```

Save the phone number and you are ready. Send your number a message and receive a reply. Type "reset" to reset the chat thread history and bdeing again.

## GPT3 Example Integration

```ts
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const response = await openai.createCompletion({
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  prompt: "Please reply to the chat below:\n",
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 256,
  top_p: 1,
  frequency_penalty: 0,
  presence_penalty: 0,
});
```
